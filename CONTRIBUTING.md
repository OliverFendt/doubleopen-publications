# Contributing to Double Open publications

Entry on 15-02-2019: We are looking to publish an updated version (2) on our landscape survey in March 2019. For this we are looking for additions of new tools, and better descriptions for existing tools and other work. If you promote a tool, or otherwise are willing to contribute, we welcome pull requests. Please work on the dev-branch and let us know of your plans.

# Contributors
All contributors are expected to add their GitHub user account names and real names to this list. Adding the name equals confirming acceptance of the project license (CC-BY-4.0 in file LICENSE) and the contributor's authority to contribute.
